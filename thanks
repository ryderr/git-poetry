thanks guys, we said, and turned back to our work.

 we packed up our violin crates, and a few short songs tumbled out,
 but they weren't compelling enough to make us consider writing a letter
 desecribing the songs and mailing it to our parents - or anyone else's.
 we took the crates to the warehouse and put 'em over there, near a 
 few tubs with carp, bass, and walleye salmon. these tubs were under a 
 scaffolding with several spots for rifle mounts, and even a little 
chute to catch the excess cartridge shells. 

it's harder than it sounds.
