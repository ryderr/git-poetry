out in the hall the lights blink  
as i try to think what the spec said again  
it’s been too long since i felt warm and steady  
since i felt i was ready to complete this task

no sweet lament to this sad omission  
this terminal condition of uncertainty  
be i hooked into circuitous solutions  
or ugly convolutions from forum posts

tomorrow or today, i can’t tell which  
i will flick the switch on this production server  
i will placate the suits with a smiling face  
hiding all of my sadness with a single rebase
