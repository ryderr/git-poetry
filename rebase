out in the hall the lights blink
as i try to think what the spec said again
it’s been too long since i felt warm and steady
since i felt i was ready to complete this task

no sweet lament to this sad omission
this terminal condition of uncertainty
be i hooked into circuitous solutions
or ugly convolutions from forum posts

tomorrow or today, i can’t tell which
i will flick the switch on this production server
i will placate the suits with a smiling face
hiding all of my sadness with a single rebase
