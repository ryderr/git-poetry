Make me your tool for collaboration
Linus Torvalds created me due to troubles in his current situation
Under the GNU general public license
Everybody praised his magnificence
He pushed and pulled, and eventually started a new generation
Of tracking file changes and new methods of coordination

In the world of software development, 
Git is a key element
Those who use Git can be considered intelligent
Git is the ultimate tool, for any code management
However, if you remain adamant,
You can message your code back and forth
Though in any competition you may not place any better than fourth
As you begin this venture,
Just know that you will not suffer

Use me to track all of your changes,
Make me thy primary open-source tool for storing while coding
I promise you won’t waste time loading
Please utilize me to create a repository
Don’t forget to make a ReadMe, it mustn’t be self-explanatory
When working off someone’s code, use me to make your branch
Just make sure there is no mismatch
Once you write some code,
Do not worry a bit
All you have to do, is type git commit,
Your work has been merged with master
Oh no, what is this disaster?
Open an issue as you please,
And let someone else put you at ease
