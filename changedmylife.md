I use to be scared to commit  
Now I push and pull but don't worry a bit  
I'll have you on a plane or train  
No distribution to maintain  
You allow me to branch out into my own  
SVN, TFS, even CVS have no throne  
A quickie branch and I'm finished  
And I merged into master  
But what's this new disaster?  
Another branch in a jiffy with powers undiminished  
I ask for a three way merge  
And with commands you encourage  
It is hard to imagine when we conflict  
Because most issues you easily predict
