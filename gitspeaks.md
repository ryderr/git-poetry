--------------------------------

`git status`

All your files  
 are up to date  
You’ve shown no activity  
 as of late  

`git checkout -b`  
Getting your act together, I see.  

I know you’re in a rush,  
 but all the same  
it would be a good idea  
 to specify the branch name.

`git checkout -b \`  
 `all-bugs-eradication`  
All? You may be enthusiastic,  
 but isn’t that too much ambition?

`./test.py`  
Testing…done. But why!

Not a single bug found—  
 that’s too good to be true!  
Oh, wait, there’s no code either.  
 Lots of work ahead for you!

`git checkout master`  
 Are you planning to work faster?

Or leave it to someone else  
 in the spirit of collaboration?  
`git branch -d \  
 all-bugs-eradication`

It’s the latter, I see.
