I use to be scared to commit
Now I push and pull but don't worry a bit
I'll have you on a plane or train
No distribution to maintain
You allow me to branch out into my own
SVN, TFS, even CVS have no throne 
A quickie branch and I'm finished
And I merged into master
But what's this new disaster?
Another branch in a jiffy with powers undiminished
I ask for a three way merge
And with commands you encourage
It is hard to imagine when we conflict
Because most issues you easily predict
